<h1> Today I Made A Website. </h1>
<p style="font-family:calibri;"> For this assignment, I tried to fine-tune the HTML assignment we'd just done previously in order to make it look and feel the way I wanted it to last time.
 I'd had trouble with incorporating my images before, and that certainly wound up being the problem this time around. Importing everything into GitHub was dandy, but the moment I tried to launch
 the website, nothing loaded and my panic began to ensue. It took a while of hair pulling and combing through my code to realize my embarassing mistake: I didn't import one of my images and that
 just so happened to break the rest of it. So that's fun! I wound up fixing that, and everything else ended up working great! </p>
